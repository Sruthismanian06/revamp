<h1>Software Components of MERN</h1>

<h3>Mongo DB</h3>
<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like BSON (binary JSON) documents with schema
The role of the database in the MERN stack is very commonly filled by MongoDB because its use of JSON-like documents for interacting with data as opposed to the row/column model allows it to integrate well with the other (JavaScript-based) components of the stack.

<h3>Express js</h3>
<p>Express.js (also referred to as Express) is a modular web application framework for Node.js.
Whilst Express is capable of acting as an internet-facing web server, even supporting SSL/TLS out of the box, it is often used in conjunction with a reverse proxy such as NGINX or Apache for performance reasons.

<h3>React js</h3>
<p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing.
Redux and React Routerare respective examples of such libraries.
</p>

<h3>Node js</h3>
<p>Node. js is the runtime environment for execution of JavaScript code on the server side, coordinating communication between front-end and back-end components. As a group, these components make the MERN stack a preferred choice for developers seeking an efficient, full-stack development framework.
   It lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development with JavaScript. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications efficiently
